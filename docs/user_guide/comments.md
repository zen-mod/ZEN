# Comments

Zeus Enhanced adds the ability to create and edit comments through Zeus.
In addition, comments created in 3DEN are imported into Zeus.

### Creating

Comments can be created by using the context menu action.
The context menu action is only shown when comments are enabled in the CBA settings.

### Editing

The properties of comments can be changed by double clicking on the icon of the comment.
This will open a menu that allows you to configure the comment's title, tooltip, and color.

Comments can be moved by left clicking and dragging on the icon.
Comments created in 3DEN cannot be moved.

### Deleting

Comments can be deleted by hovering over the icon and pressing the <kbd>DELETE</kbd> key.
By default, comments created in 3DEN cannot be deleted. This can be changed in the CBA settings.

## 3DEN Comments {docsify-ignore}

All comments created in 3DEN will be imported into Zeus by default.
A comment can be excluded by unchecking the "Show comment in Zeus" option when creating/editing a comment in 3DEN.

!> The mission must be saved; otherwise, 3DEN comments will not be shown in Zeus!
